#!/bin/sh

# This script deploys a mini-website that is built/uses mykomap. It
# uses `rsync` to synchronise a remote directory to match a local
# directory (`rsync` is therefore obviously a requirement).
#
# General usage:
#
#     mykomap-site-deploy [-f <from dir> ] [-t <to url>] [-u <user>] [-g <group>]
#  
# It is intended to be run as an NPM run-script, both within `mykomap`
# itself, and consuming packages.  Therefore it accepts by default
# package.json parameters values exposed by NPM via the environment
# variables prefixed with `npm_`, as described here:
#
# https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts#environment
#
# The main parameters you need to define override the defaults in the
# `config` block, which are:
#
#     "config": {
#       "deploy_to": "",
#       "deploy_user": "www-data",
#       "deploy_group": "www-data"
#     },
#
# These define:
#
#  - `deploy_to`: the destination URL to pass to `rsync`
#  - `deploy_user`: the user who should own the deployed files
#  - `deploy_group`: the group who should own the deployed files
#
# As described in the package.json documentation, these default values
# can be overridden on a per-package basis. For example, to set
# `deploy_to` to something else for an NPM package called `mypackage`:
#
#     npm config set mypackage:deploy_to=example.com:/some/path
#
# To support scripting, however, the parameters `-t`, `-u` and `-g`
# can be supplied, and will override all of the above
# configuration. The `-f` parameter will override the hardwired
# default source directory  `build/out`.
#
# (As of NPM v2.0.0, any trailing parameters passed to npm when
# invoking a run-script are passed to the script verbatim, see link
# below.)
#
# https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-run-script
#
# (Also, as of NPM v7, npm_package_config_* variables no longer get
# their values from the configured values in .npmrc; therefore it is
# neccessary to get them using `npm config get ...` and set the
# variables as a workaround within this script.)
#
# This means you can deploy to a host `joe@example.com:/some/other/path`
# whatever the configuration, using:
#
#     npm run deploy -- -t joe@example.com:/some/other/path
#
# ...assuming the run script is named `deploy` like below:
#
#     "scripts": {
#       "deploy": "bin/mykomap-site-deploy"
#     },
#
