The main objective is to improve the welfare of its members. Therefore they perform social and cultural activities going far beyond their economic operations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Governance Consumers&#39; cooperatives utilize the cooperative principle of democratic member control, or one member\/one vote. Most consumers&#39; cooperatives have a board of directors elected by and from the membership. The board is usually responsible for hiring management and ensuring that the cooperative meets its goals, both fiscal and otherwise. Democratic functions, such as petitioning or recall of board members, may be codified in the bylaws or organizing document of the cooperative. Most consumers&#39; cooperatives hold regular membership meetings (often once a year). HistoryThe history of Japanese Consumers&#39; Co-operative dates back in the 1919. Japanese Co-operative Society was initiated during the era of Taisho democracy. In 1919, the &quot;Katei Kobai (purchasing) union&quot; was established in Tokyo. During the following year, 1920, the &quot;Kyoueki-sha Kobai union&quot; was established, in Osaka, and in 1921 the &quot;Limited responsibility Kobe Kobai union&quot; was also established in Kobe. This gives the starting history of the regional purchasing co-op. By entering the Showa period (1926), the strengthened economic control and the staffs&#39; compulsory military drafts by war almost suffocated co-op. After the end of the war in 1945, in the severe food shortage and exceptional inflation, co-ops were established once again across the country. In 1947, about three million people became members nationwide. In 1948, the law for consumers&#39; cooperative union was enacted and in 1951, Japan Consumers&#39; Cooperative Union was established. During 1950s, co-ops for regional labors and institutional co-ops were established across the country. During the years of steep economic growth in 1960s, the consumers&#39; movement against price inflations and harmful food additives was promoted. Co-op led the movement. Between the end of 1960s and 1970s, community residents as its members organized citizen&#39;s co-ops. These citizen&#39;s co-ops built up the non-store business such as joint purchasing and individual deliveries. Japanese co-ops are in a new developing period now. Today, Co-ops are an integral part of communities with 37% of all households in Japan belonging to a Co-op.( Source: &nbsp;&quot;History&quot; , Japanese Consumers&#39; Co-operative Union ( JCCU) website, Date of Access: May 23th 2016,<\/p>\n\n<p>http:\/\/jccu.coop\/eng\/aboutus\/history.php<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For a Better Tomorrow&rdquo; http:\/\/jccu.coop\/eng\/public\/pdf\/better_2012.pdf,<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Facts&amp;Figures 2014&rdquo; http:\/\/jccu.coop\/eng\/public\/pdf\/ff_2014.pdf)<\/p>","street":"Co-op Plaza, 3-29-8 Shibuya Shibuya-ku","locality":"Tokyo","baseMembershipType":"https:\/\/dev.lod.coop\/essglobal\/2.1\/standard\/base-membership-type\/BMT10","postcode":"150 8913","primaryActivity":"https:\/\/dev.lod.coop\/essglobal\/2.1\/standard\/activities-ica\/ICA260","activity":"https:\/\/dev.lod.coop\/essglobal\/2.1\/standard\/activities-ica\/ICA230","manLng":"0","manLat":"0","dataset":"ica"},{"name":"National Federation of Agricultural Co-operative Associations (ZEN-NOH)","uri":"https:\/\/dev.lod.coop\/ica\/104","within":"https:\/\/www.openstreetmap.org\/?mlat=35.688107&mlon=139.765369","lat":"35.688107","lng":"139.765369","www":"http:\/\/www.zennoh.or.jp","regorg":"https:\/\/dev.lod.coop\/essglobal\/2.1\/standard\/organisational-structure\/OS190","desc":"<p>ZEN-NOH is a federation to handle economic businesses of marketing and supplying.

OCFCU Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (OCFCU) is a small farmers owned cooperative union. OCFCU works exclusively in Oromia Regional State, which accounts for more than 65 % of the country&#39;s total coffee growing land. OCFCU is a democratic member&#39;s owned business operating under the principles of International Cooperative Alliance and fair trade. Members of Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union are the growers, processors and suppliers of high quality, organic Arabica coffee for the direct export. OCFCU exports traceable, fair trade, organic, UTZ, and Rain Forest Alliance certified coffees. The fair trade premium and support from roasters are invested in social projects like schools, health posts, clean water, bridges, etc. More than 365 different projects have been completed and provided to the farmers. OCFCU pays 70% of its net profit back to the cooperatives and the cooperatives also pay 70% of their profit to the member farmers. This shows that farmers are benefited by being paid three times in one coffee season. This has enabled OCFCU to grow from 34 primary cooperatives representing 22,691 household farmers to 360 primary cooperatives representing 332,393 household farmers and 90,000 USD initial capital to 20,763,000 USD capital. The life of farmers has improved and has also got social service in their village. OCFCU now have a cupping lab for quality control located at its office and have massive central facility for technical, financial, administrative and also high tech processing facility namely Gelan, Dire Dawa and Kality with capacity of 5-7 tons per hour, 3-4 tons per hour, 11 tons per hour respectivly. The processing facility has created a job for more than 2,000 Seasonal employees. OCFCU have recently created its own members bank which is one of the greatest benefits to its own members for the much needed pre-harvest financing.

Traditionally, &lsquo;Equbs&rsquo; and &lsquo;Idirs&rsquo; are informal institutions that are deeply ingrained in the life communities and have also been serving financial needs of the society. Reluctance and low capacity of the financial institutions in the country to serve rural community, a demand-supply gap prevailed in financial market especially in rural areas, coupled with farmers awareness to be organized in to cooperatives and the increasing need to finance cooperatives&rsquo; called for establishment of a cooperative bank. Furthermore, finance appeared to be the critical bottleneck to sustain the cooperative institutions and ultimately the farmers. It was all these glitches that initiated the inception and establishment of Cooperative Bank of Oromia.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mr. Haile Gebre Lube, regarded as the founding father (proponent) of Ethiopia&rsquo;s cooperatives, brought the idea of founding the bank for he believed that the best way to fight poverty is through cooperation. Formally establishing a project once in 2002, the bank&rsquo;s formation was realized with majority of shareholders being the cooperative societies. The bank then is commercially licensed in October 2004 and commenced operations in March 2005. As there is no legal provisions that allow establishment of a cooperative bank in the country, the bank was registered in accordance with article 304 of the commercial code of Ethiopia although about 73% of its share was owned by cooperatives at the time of establishment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, 65% of the share of the bank is owned by primary cooperatives, cooperative unions and cooperative federations.
